# Next.js 15 Image Optimization Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 related to image optimization.  Despite configuring `next.config.js` correctly, images loaded with `next/image` are not being optimized.

## Bug Description
Images are not being optimized even when the `next.config.js` file is properly configured. This results in larger image sizes being loaded, impacting page load performance.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the image loading in the browser.  The image will not be optimized.

## Expected Behavior
Images should be optimized according to the configuration in `next.config.js`.

## Actual Behavior
Images are not optimized; their original, unoptimized size is loaded.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the image paths used in `next/image` are correct and conform to the defined image optimization settings, and checking for conflicts with other plugins or configurations.
